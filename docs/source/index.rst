`EduNLP <https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduNLP>`_ is a library for advanced Natural Language Processing in Python and is one of the projects of `EduX <https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduX>`_ plan of BDAA.
It's built on the very latest research, and was designed from day one to be used in real educational products.

EduNLP now comes with pretrained pipelines and currently supports segment, tokenization and vertorization. It supports varies of preprocessing for NLP in educational scenario, such as formula parsing, multi-modal segment.

EduNLP is commercial open-source software, released under the `Apache-2.0 license <https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/EduNLP/blob/master/LICENSE>`_.

Install
---------
EduNLP requires Python version 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9. EduNLP use PyTorch as the backend tensor library.

v0.0.6:
    1. dev: add half-pretrained rnn model
    2. important!!!: rename TextTokenizer to PureTextTokenizer, and add a new tokenizer named TextTokenizer (the two have similar but not the same behaviours).
    3. sif: add $\textf{}$ syntax
    4. add two pretrained w2v model: w2v_sci_300 and w2v_lit_300

    1. fix the missing stopwords.txt when use pip install

v0.0.4:
    1. fix the project errors

v0.0.3:
    1. update formula ast: supporting more symbols and functions defined in katex
    2. add tokens to vector tools, including word2vec and doc2vec using gensim
    3. sci4sif support tokenization grouped by segments
    4. add special tokens: \SIFTag and \SIFSep
    5. add item to vector tools
    6. add interface for getting pretrained models, where the supported model names can be accessed by `edunlp i2v` in the command console

v0.0.2:
    1. fix potential ModuleNotFoundError

v0.0.1:
